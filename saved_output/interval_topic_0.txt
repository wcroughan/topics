B: fine . Like having to uh it's
C: Hmm . Mm . As long as it comes out in the end . That's
B: Yeah . No , I'm just I'm trying to think of the things that could go wrong . Um but since I haven't tried it this particular
C: Mm .
B: way , you know , um but yeah , that sounds good . So um so you say we haven't finalised what the G_D_F_ looks like . Is that an implicit request for me to do something ? Or Uh-huh . Yeah . As a well , I mean there's two two cases in here , right . There's things you can get straight off the original format , and then there's things you have to do some kind of post-processing of the original format . But it's not just a data format change , it's actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well , right ? And it wasn't uh I think it was a little bit um confused uh last time we spoke about um whether whether you consider G_D_F_ format to be um the thing that's just the straight-forward translations of what's in the original eye-tracking output , or whether like whether the post-processing utilities are a separate step . 'Cause I think you and I had separate different views on this , but I can't remember who had which view at this point . So are you working uh actively on this these analysis things or you just working on the translation ? Uh so the data format translation . Oh okay . So you haven't
A: . . Okay . Well , you know , apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get Camtasia sorted out . Yeah , I haven't I haven't added anything to the Wiki recently . So uh 'Cause I've we've been been working on trying to get the X_M_L_ stuff working . So some the basically they only had to how the DOM works , um so I can do the next so I can generate D_D_F_ files . Huh ? Um so so yeah , so just just been reading through documentation , that's what I was doing the end of last week um just so I know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things . Um but I'm at the moment I've I've been playing with the DOM stuff in Mozilla . Uh 'cause I 'cause uh just so at least I can see how it works with the H_T_M_L_ pages so I can generate um the X_ so I can generate X_H_T_M_L_ stuff and see how it all works there . Just 'cause to just see how things work in that um and It well , thing is that the A_ the A_ well the A_P_I_ is standardized by the W_ three C_ . So the A_P_I_ is is standard between everything . Um Uh or Yeah , yeah , yeah . It is . It it just has a couple of yeah , yeah . Um well yeah but if they will but it does look like it does does that this is and things like that . So I was doing the is anyway . Um it's it's just that that's that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works . Because I can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah , add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time . So Oh well just 'cause X_H_T_M_L_ has a nice you know , you got browsers there , so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on . Yeah , well I'll I'm using X_H_T_M_L_ uh to that's uh all all the web pages are X_H_T_M_L_ . So it's X_M_L_ just with the H_T_M_L_ D_T_D_ . Yeah . just just 'cause we haven't uh we haven't haven't quite finalised the um the G_D_F_ format . So just just well just Yeah , yeah . So all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but Um that what what what what I'm doing the moment I'm looking through the the uh stuff that Robin put on the Wiki to say what's , you know , what what we need in the in the um in the output format for the for the task , you know . So what what you're what you're gonna do the analysis on . Um so I'm making sure that I can take get that information out of the G_D_F_ as it state of the moment . And if I find something that you can't get out of it then I can add that to the add that to the G_D_F_ format . So Yeah , yeah . Yeah , well the Well I'm I'm I'm try I'm making sure that the G_D_F_ format we've got at the moment will will output say well I've output old analysis that that Robin's looking for . Um so so I'm using that as a way to to get into using the DOM things as well . Um so yeah . So at the moment I'm looking at actually the G_D_F_ format itself um and then to generate the G_D_F_ format I'm gonna be taking stuff out of the [31mgest[0m [31manalyser[0m um and then using a DOM parser to generate uh X_M_L_ output from the
