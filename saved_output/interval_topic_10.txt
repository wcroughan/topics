B: .
A: Oh yeah . I
D: Yes , it's a [31mstereo[0m jack . It's a [31mstereo[0m jack . But it's a mono but it's a mono uh [31mmicrophone[0m . Mono
A: know but so you you got a solution for that then ?
D: mono [31mrecording[0m on [31mmicrophone[0ms . Line in . Uh going going through a line in . So it's a so it's a so it's quieter
A: Oh right , okay . Yeah .
D: because it's not as though it's not powered . But it's still , think , yeah . We we still pick up a signal .
B: Can Yeah , can we do
A: You're sure there's not a better solution that involves 'Cause
B: can we do something better than that ? Like having
A: , you know , people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something . You never know if it's the data is
B: Yeah . Yeah , I mean it's it's crazy . We're in an anechoic
A: there then You know .
B: room which we specially , yeah , built an anechoic . But , you know , sound room which we specially built for
A: Yeah . And you're gonna want forced alignment .
B: this . We're in good circumstances . We shouldn't screw it up more than we have to . Is there anything we can do to improve this ?
D: Yeah . Yeah .
A: Oh no . Well no no . Better to collect
B: No . No , no . Do you have a powered [31mmicrophone[0m or something .
A: and sort . Uh well it's the mono
D: Well the the when they are they are the the they have batteries in them . But there's not doesn't . But doesn't seem to be powered because the because the line input's so low .
A: Wait wait , I I thought the that a better solution was fixing this problem
B: Right .
A: with the mono [31mmicrophone[0m socket . Sound card ? So you said the problem was the the is expecting a mono [31mmicrophone[0m input .
D: The the sound the sound the
B: That the line is [31mstereo[0m , the input is mono . Right ? Is that what you said ? Right .
D: Well the yeah , the the yeah , the the the the jack that is that it's plugged into is [31mstereo[0m . But when you plug in when it's
B: Is ah .
D: [31mrecording[0m from [31mmicrophone[0m , it records in mono .
A: So is that fixable ? Like is there any way yeah . Uh I
B: That's somewhere in the sound card .
D: And yeah . A new sound card is fixable .
A: think a new sound card sounds a better solution than monkeying about with trying to filter white noise out .
D: Yeah . think we we have a well I I suppose it well one one thing you do is uh is record the speech signal separately for each for each person . But then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together
