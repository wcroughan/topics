B: It's yeah , okay , right .
C: if what you have is a sort of larger error or of error margin around it .
B: Okay . So my question was going to be alright , the the
D: Yeah .
B: [31mmouse[0m is a dynamic object , right . The eye track is a dynamic object ? Or is it only the the piece that the eye the other person's eye track is on that's that's an object in this definition ?
C: Uh no . The the other person's [31mgaze[0m position as well . Mm-hmm . Yep
B: Is a is an object . Okay . With some with plus or minus
C: . treated the same as as the [31mmouse[0m say . Yep . Mm-hmm .
B: something or other , yeah , around it . Some circular area . Okay
C: Yes , yep .
B: . And Um so you can be on the object but not on the other person's [31mgaze[0m . So there can be a triangle which has A_'s [31mgaze[0m in
C: Yes . So if there uh if mm-hmm .
B: the centre and your [31mgaze[0m actually happens to be here . You're in the triangle region
C: Yes . But not looking at their individual
A: Mm-hmm .
B: . Does this Okay
C: and fact , they probably will avoid looking directly . Because
B: .
C: if they're looking directly at it , it's obscuring the the part .
B: But it's directly added when when these two in this situation when these two overlap
C: Mm-hmm . Yeah , mm-hmm .
B: , right , like this . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm
A: Yeah .
B: . Mm-hmm . Well it would come up it would say
C: The
B: yes , right ? I mean because they would be in the same place . So if you you're gonna have dynamic
A: I don't know .
C: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm
B: regions which overlap one another by definition . If the [31mmouse[0m is on the construct , then
C: . The the [31mmouse[0m , the [31mgaze[0m and the part are all layered
B: right , right .
A: Well well but those are different [31mtracks[0m of information
C: .
A: . So what you want is one track of information about which object
B: Right .
A: it's one , one about whether or not it's on the other guy's [31mgaze[0m , and one about whether it's on um one of the [31mmouse[0m positions .
B: We treat those as as other objects . But the difference between them and the the parts of the thing
