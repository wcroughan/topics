B: I think should be in there .
C: S Yeah , okay . Yep .
B: emission lines . Quasars I missed .
C: Yep . Ooh . Those shouldn't be there , should they ? No .
B: Damped Lyman also is not systems , yeah .
C: Oh okay , okay , okay .
A: Well hang on though , but um Is it just um to scrub your mechanism there ? It isn't uh a [31mspectral[0m [31mfeature[0m such as
C: yes .
B: Mm no , I think it's a [31mspectral[0m [31mfeature[0m . You can point to the [31mdamped[0m
A: oh , it's a process .
B: Lyman [31malpha[0m resorption , in in the same way you can point to H_ beta emission , although H_ beta emission is a process . Or emission from H_ beta is is a process .
C: I think this is what we agreed to cross out before
A: Mm-hmm .
C: , isn't it ?
B: No , the [31mdamped[0m Lyman [31malpha[0m [31mabsorption[0m systems we crossed out . We also crossed out
A: Mm-hmm . I think it's a process myself .
C: I think it's a process too , I think Especially when uh they're saying we're we're choosing low red-shift [31mabsorption[0m . That's not really something you can point to .
B: What did we do back Mm you can point to low red shift [31mdamped[0m Lyman [31malpha[0m [31mabsorption[0m 'cause you're shifted in the [31mspectrum[0m there .
C: Mm . I'm not too fast , I don't think .
B: Um would it be if it was H_ beta [31mabsorption[0m ? And you just took out the low red shifts . Quasars with H_ beta [31mabsorption[0m you'd put in .
C: Mm no I'm not sure .
B: Because it's a [31mspectral[0m [31mfeature[0m . I think [31mdamped[0m Lyman [31malpha[0m [31mabsorption[0m
C: It's whether it's a process or a a [31mfeature[0m . But I can't remember what we've done before .
B: I think it's both . Because we've every [31mfeature[0m is produced
D: Sorry
