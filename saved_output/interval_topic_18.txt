B: Oh yeah . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Um the oh , well um I don't know the Mozilla stuff . So if it turns out that it's idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits , then it won't have been a good idea . So Yeah , yeah . Uh well there are certain companies um that I don't wanna name who don't always get it right . I but yeah , Mozilla . Yeah , it'll be alright . So okay . I believe you now , it's a good strategy . Mm-hmm . Uh why does it help that it's X_T_ H_T_M_L_ instead of just X_M_L_ ? Yeah , but most most browsers , when when you uh put an X_M_L_ file up in it , it'll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you Okay , yeah . Okay , so all you're gonna have to do is swap in tag names later . Okay . everybody's got their different ways of doing these things . I'm sure that's fine
C: Hmm
A: . . Okay . Well , you know , apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get Camtasia sorted out . Yeah , I haven't I haven't added anything to the Wiki recently . So uh 'Cause I've we've been been working on trying to get the X_M_L_ stuff working . So some the basically they only had to how the DOM works , um so I can do the next so I can generate D_D_F_ files . Huh ? Um so so yeah , so just just been reading through documentation , that's what I was doing the end of last week um just so I know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things . Um but I'm at the moment I've I've been playing with the DOM stuff in Mozilla . Uh 'cause I 'cause uh just so at least I can see how it works with the H_T_M_L_ pages so I can generate um the X_ so I can generate X_H_T_M_L_ stuff and see how it all works there . Just 'cause to just see how things work in that um and It well , thing is that the A_ the A_ well the A_P_I_ is standardized by the W_ three C_ . So the A_P_I_ is is standard between everything . Um Uh or Yeah , yeah , yeah . It is . It it just has a couple of yeah , yeah . Um well yeah but if they will but it does look like it does does that this is and things like that . So I was doing the is anyway . Um it's it's just that that's that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works . Because I can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah , add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time . So Oh well just 'cause X_H_T_M_L_ has a nice you know , you got browsers there , so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on . Yeah , well I'll I'm using X_H_T_M_L_ uh to that's uh all all the web pages are X_H_T_M_L_ . So it's X_M_L_ just with the H_T_M_L_ D_T_D_ . Yeah . just just 'cause we haven't uh we haven't haven't quite finalised the um the G_D_F_ format . So just just well just Yeah , yeah . So all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah . Yeah .
