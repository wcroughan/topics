B: there's hub set A_ is transcribed I think um in final form . You we can check the Wikis . But you know , the data is rolling in . So
D: So we got stuck at some point on evaluation of [31mchunking[0m , right . The problem was you didn't have ICSI data that was hand labelled for chunks
A: Or AMI data . no .
D: . And we decided labelling the ICSI data for chunks would be probably difficult and maybe not very useful . And so it it
B: And but Barbara still says somebody's done this for chunks . I'll have to look up , you know , so
A: Okay . So
D: Okay , if there if there was if there was hand labelled data that you could [31mevaluate[0m so train on some and [31mevaluate[0m on some , wouldn't that um 'cause you've trained on Switchboard , right , where there there are chunks . So
A: Mm-hmm .
D: if you had some ICSI data that you could maybe use , I don't know , um as a what's the there's
A: Yeah .
D: there's a training set and then there's the development set and then there's the test set . Maybe you'd use some chunked ICSI stuff as development or something and do some last tweaks and then [31mevaluate[0m
A: Mm-hmm .
B: Mm .
D: . But you know , I mean I can see why Wei-Xun didn't wanna spend his time [31mchunking[0m ICSI Which means we have to get some portion of the data hand-chunked .
B: Hand-chunked . Mm-hmm . But that shouldn't be that hard to do , right ? How much data do you need ? I don't read
D: How much um well how
B: lips . What was that ? Was it hard ?
D: much in Switchboard
C: .
D: . Switchboard is all chunked . Right .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah . They the data how much data you need was not a problem with the Switchboard 'cause he had lots . So he didn't have to think about how much . So we need to know how much data you need hand-chunked
D: Right . Well
B: . And then uh how do you hand-chunk stuff
