E: out of that . Like fifty percent or something with a good algorithm . So if you could compress it and just put it into a temp directory . Like
D: I'm not sure if there's enough space . Is how much do we get ?
E: The temp the temps usually have for gigabyte three or two . The temps , yeah . I like
D: Really ? Okay .
E: I mean there's not guarantee that anything stays there , but overnight it'll stay . And I think the temps usually have . Ah yeah , but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can S_S_H_ into directory of S_S_H_ .
